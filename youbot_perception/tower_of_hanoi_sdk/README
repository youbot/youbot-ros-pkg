1. Installation
===============

-- We assume that BRICS_3D and ROS(diamondback - at least) is already installed in your system. If not:
	-- For ROS Installation: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation
	-- For BRICS_3D Installation: < link will be updated soon :) >
 
-- Place the downloaded tower_of_hanoi_sdk such that it is reachable through your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

-- To build the package:
	$ roscd tower_of_hanoi_sdk
	$ rosmake

-- If the package builds with no failures then go ahead and start detecting the objects :)


2. Basic Usage
==============

	2-a.  HSV Limits Finder
	=====================	    
	First we need to find the best Hue and Saturation limits so that our perception system can 
	correctly distinguish the objects of interests in the current lightning conditions. To find 
	the HSV limits we will use the hsvLimitsFinder node.

	-- Start the kinect driver	
	
		$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

	-- Start the HSV-Limit Finder node:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk hsvLimitsFinder
	
	This will start extracting a ROI with some default Hue-Saturation Limits. To change the limits in real-time
	we need to use the dynamic_configure tool. 
	
	-- Start the dynamic configure tool, use:
		
		$rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui

	Select the "/hsvLimitsFinder" in the dynamic configure gui to change the Hue-Saturation Limits. To visualize 
	the extracted region based on current limits use the rviz tool and subscribe to the topic "extracted_region_1" 
	with "Fixed Frame = /openni_rgb_optical_frame". For usage detail of rviz: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz
		
	
	To save the current configuration of Hue-Saturation Limits, interrupt the hsvLimitsFinder node using Ctrl+c. 
	The program will prompt for saving the configuration. Enter "y" to continue and "n" to exit. Please enter the 
	full-relative path with the filename when prompted. For example: "./demoHSVConfig.cfg"


	2-b. Color Based Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction
	==================================================
	
	The node extracts the region in the input image which satisfies a HSV-space color configuration. 
	The color-configuration is acceted from the user for extraction purpose.
	
	Usage:
	
	-- Start the kinect driver	
	
		$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

	-- Start the Color Based ROI Extractor Node:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor <no_of_different_regions> <hsv_config_file_1> 
			<hsv_config_file_2> .....
	
		<no_of_regions>:     This refers to the number of different color based ROI we want to extract
		<hsv_config_file_n>: This refers to the full-relative file path (including the filename) which
				     will be used to extract the nth ROI. 
				     Number of <hsv_config_file_n> = <no_of_regions>

		For example :
		
			$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor 1 ./demoHSVCon1.cfg ./demoHSVCon2.cfg


	The extracted regions of interests will be published with the topic names: extracted_region_n
	To visualize the extracted region based use the rviz tool and subscribe to the topics "extracted_region_1",
	"extracted_region_2" and so on with "Fixed Frame = /openni_rgb_optical_frame".


	2-c. Object Cluster Extractor and 3d pose estimator
	=================================================
	The objectClusterExtractor node finds the object clusters in the extracted ROIs by the node colorBasedRoiExtractor explained above. 
	The  node finds the clusters and publishes:

	-- individual object cluster with topic name: "region_n_obj_cluster_m"
	   n = corresponds region number in the topic "extracted_region_n" from  colorBasedRoiExtractor	 
	   m = cluster number in the order of detection by the algorithm

	-- 3D pose of the clusters: a tf frame for each object-cluster with respect to the "openni_rgb_optical_frame"
	   of kinect driver with the topic name : "region_n_obj_cluster_m"	

	Usage:
	
	-- Start the kinect driver	
	
		$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

	-- Start the Color Based ROI Extractor Node:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor <no_of_different_regions> <hsv_config_file_1> 
			<hsv_config_file_2> .....
	
		<no_of_regions>     : This refers to the number of different color based ROI we want to extract
		<hsv_config_file_n> : This refers to the full-relative file path (including the filename) which
				      will be used to extract the nth ROI. 
				      Number of <hsv_config_file_n> = <no_of_regions>

		For example :
		
			$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor 1 ./demoHSVCon1.cfg ./demoHSVCon2.cfg
	
	-- Start the object cluster extraction node:
		
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk objectClusterExtractor <max_no_of_regions> <max_no_of_objects_possible>

		<max_no_of_regions>          : max number of object clusters possible in each region, default value 1       
		<max_no_of_objects_possible> : corresponds to the count of difrent regions of intersets, ex: green, red 
					       default value 1


	2-d. Model Fitting
	==================

	The modelFittingICP node finds the 6D pose of a cube best approximating the object clusters in the extracted 
	ROIs  explained above. It uses ICP to fit a model of cube into the cluster-cloud.
	
	The modelFittingICP node calculates the best approximating pose and publishes:

	-- individual final-transformed cube model with topic name: "region_n_obj_model_m"
	   n = corresponds region number in the topic "extracted_region_n" from  colorBasedRoiExtractor	 
	   m = cluster/object number in the order of detection by the objectClusterExtractor node

	-- 6D pose of the clusters: a tf frame for each object-cluster with respect to the "openni_rgb_optical_frame"
	   of kinect driver with the topic name : "region_n_obj_cluster_m_frame"	

	Usage:
	
	-- Start the kinect driver	
	
		$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

	-- Start the Color Based ROI Extractor Node:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor <no_of_different_regions> <hsv_config_file_1> 
			<hsv_config_file_2> .....
	
		<no_of_regions>     : This refers to the number of different color based ROI we want to extract
		<hsv_config_file_n> : This refers to the full-relative file path (including the filename) which
				      will be used to extract the nth ROI. 
				      Number of <hsv_config_file_n> = <no_of_regions>

		For example :
		
			$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk colorBasedRoiExtractor 1 ./demoHSVCon1.cfg ./demoHSVCon2.cfg
	
	-- Start the object cluster extraction node:
		
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk objectClusterExtractor <max_no_of_regions> <max_no_of_objects_possible>

		<max_no_of_regions>          : max number of object clusters possible in each region, default value 1       
		<max_no_of_objects_possible> : corresponds to the count of difrent regions of intersets, ex: green, red 
					       default value 1

	-- Start the model fitting node:
		
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk modelFittingICP <max_no_of_regions> <max_no_of_objects_possible>

		<max_no_of_regions>          : max number of object clusters possible in each region, default value 1       
		<max_no_of_objects_possible> : corresponds to the count of difrent regions of intersets, ex: green, red 
					       default value 1
	
	
	
	2-e. Pose Estimation 6D
	=======================
	
	The PoseEstimation6DNode can be used to estimate the poses of the objects from the kinect-camera
	view. A launch file PoseEstimation6D.launch is provided to set up the relevant parameters and 
	user inputs required by the node initially. Following parameters are alwaye required by the node:
		
		-- No of regions of interests to be extracted
		-- Maximum number of object to be found in each ROI
		-- HSV-Limits Configuration Files with full path
		-- Region Labes used by the nodes to publish the transforms
	
	
	2-f Controlling the Pose-Estimation Node
	========================================
	
	The pose estimation node subsribes to /perceptionControl messages which can be used to 
	pause/resume the object recognition process. An example is provided as perceptionEngineController
	node. The usage will be:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk  perceptionEngineController
		
	2-g Configuring parameters of the Pose-Estimation Node
	======================================================
	
	The pose estimation node subsribes to /perceptionConfiguration messages which can be used to 
	configure the parameters of the object recognition process. 
	An example is provided as perceptionEngineConfigurator node. The usage will be:
	
		$ rosrun tower_of_hanoi_sdk  perceptionEngineConfigurator
	 
	 Following parameters can be changed in its current version:
	 
	 	- Number of color-based ROI to be extracted
	 	- Maximum number of objects possible in each ROI
